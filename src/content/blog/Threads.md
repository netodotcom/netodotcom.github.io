Threads are the smallest unit of execution in a program, and they allow multiple tasks to be executed concurrently within the same program. In a multi-threaded application, each thread runs independently and has its own execution path, allowing for parallel processing of tasks.

When working with an API that writes to a database, threads are important because they allow for concurrent database operations. This can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of the application, as multiple threads can be used to execute database queries or write data to the database simultaneously.

Without threads, database operations would have to be executed sequentially, which could lead to performance issues and slower response times. By using threads, multiple database operations can be executed in parallel, reducing the overall time needed to complete these tasks.

However, it's important to note that concurrent access to a database can also lead to issues like data inconsistency and race conditions. Proper synchronization mechanisms, like locks or semaphores, should be implemented to ensure that the database is accessed safely and consistently by all threads.

# Introduction

Consider the scenario of a computer with a single core where four programs are currently running simultaneaously. To archive this, the computer must utilize concurrency and virtual paralelism techniques to handle the four programs running simultaneousy and the associated instructions, despite the computer's capacity being limited to executing only one instruction at a time. Scheduling algorithms are responsable to determine which program's instruction gonna be executed next.
Virtual paralelism is a simulation of multiple proccess or threads in a single processor or core.
